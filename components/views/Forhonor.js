    <p>
      For Honor is a game that can be extremely frustrating fo the average
      player. Your opponents are complete sweats that seem to only know a
      rotation of two or three moves. ANd of course I know that this mode is
      meant to be unfair in sense of the word honor , but I am tired of being
      jumped by three people at the same time. All the same it's a pretty
      entertaining game.
